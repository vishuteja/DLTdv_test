This is the develoment repository for DLTdv and friends. 

See [http://www.unc.edu/~thedrick/software1.html](Link URL) for stable versions, sample data and so on.

Current development by Ty Hedrick is focused on DLTdv6, which works on the latest versions of MATLAB, introduces a "sparse" data file format which only stores the not-NaN data and has an option for only updating the active movie, greatly reducing display latency for projects with several compressed video files.  DLTdv6 currently DOES NOT have a multi-track option, so if you're using that stick with DLTdv5 for now.
